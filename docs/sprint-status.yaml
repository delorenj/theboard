notes:
  - "Velocity declining trend observed (-23% per sprint avg)"
  - "Likely due to increasing complexity (Sprint 3-4 more complex than 1-2)"
  - "Sprint 5 has 23% buffer to account for high-risk Story 14"
  - "Holiday season (late Dec/early Jan) may impact availability"
  - "Stories 15 & 16 can slip to Sprint 6 if needed (Story 14 is critical path)"
